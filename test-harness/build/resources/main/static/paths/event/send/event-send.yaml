    This endpoint is responsible for sending a message to one event server
    and one/multiple topic(s). 

    The message will be sent as it is, without any transformation. 

    If the event server is not reachable or the topic does not exist, a status code
    202 will 

    be returned. However, if the event server is up and running and the topic
    exists, 

    the only responsibility of this endpoint is to deliver the message. What
    happens after delivery is not the 

    responsibility of this endpoint.
