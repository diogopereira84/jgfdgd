    This endpoint is responsible for generating a load of messages
    based on criteria provided in the request to the API via the LoadProfile list. 

    The generated load will have an id associated with it, thus allowing
    the messages to be injected onto an IBM MQ queue.
    
    The implementation of the endpoint creates an individual message for each combination
    of parameter values provided in the LoadProfile, up to the maximum number of messages
    defined in the Count parameter. If the number of combinations of messages generated is 
    less than the Count specified, then we iterate over the list of combinations of messages
    until the Count number of messages is reached.
