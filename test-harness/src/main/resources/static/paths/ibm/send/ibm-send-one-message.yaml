  description: >
    This endpoint is responsible for sending a message to one or multiple IBM MQ
    servers and queues. 

    The message will be sent as it is, without any transformation. 

    If the MQ server is not reachable or the queue does not exist, a status code
    202 will 

    be returned. However, if the MQ server is up and running and the queue
    exists, 

    the only responsibility of this endpoint is to deliver the message. What
    happens after delivery is not the 

    responsibility of this endpoint.
